# Al-Hajj-Finder
Inspiration

In Hajj session, all the ways gets crowded, and people get lost. Identifying the person at the same spot is an issue for the police officer. Because mostly the pilgrim will not carry his ID card. Therefore, we will need a new way to identifying the pilgrim identity. So we want to develop a quick way to identify the missing person and let his relevant know that he is missing by sending SMS to notify them.
What it does

We develop a system to find missing Pilgrims without carrying there ID's. The officer will be able to identify their identity by facial recognition. Moreover, the officer can identify the person by reading the barcode that the pilgrim is warring during Hajj. After marking the person as missing an SMS will be launched to his relevant to notify them that he has been found. The system will link all the missing centers instantly to know where they keep the missing person.
How we built it

We will use facial recognition to identify the person identity. Moreover, the officer will have to read the barcode of the pilgrim.
Challenges we ran into

Identifying pilgrim from the office mobile.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

What's next for Hajj Finder
